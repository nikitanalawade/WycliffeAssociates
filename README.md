# Testing Prime Numbers

The code has been implemented in HTML and Javascript as front end development.

The app is implemented to check whether a number is prime or not.

It has the following features:

A field for the user to enter a number named Enter Number.

Two buttons named Prime? and Reset.Prime? is used to check whether the number is prime or no and Reset is used to nullify the fields.

An output field that displays whether or not the entered number is a prime number named Result.

The app shows an error if the user enters alphabets,non numeric characters,negitive numbers etc.
